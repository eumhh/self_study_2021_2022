# Notes on secondary structure

## MXFold2 runs fine
```
discordant results vs. RNAFold
```

## RNAFold runs fine.

## UFold
```
May have to be ran through website.
```

## RosettaFold
```
Rosetta fold outputs may have to be used in the ARES RNA structure prediction.
Requires license. Could use Academic License using school emails.
```

## ARES
```
Special inputs needed. Not Fasta
'silent rosetta' or 'PDB' these may have to be ran from rosetta. Not sure why, will read their manuscript.
