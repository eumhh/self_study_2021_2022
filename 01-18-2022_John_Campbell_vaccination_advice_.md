- Everyone ages 5 and older **CAN** get vaccinated against COVID-19.

- Two doses at least 12 weeks apart. (Or 12 weeks after a positive covid test)

## In UK
- 600,000 people aged 16 and 17 have had two doses

- 889,700 in England have had at least one dose

- in line with JCVI guidance.

- *"NHS cannot vaccinate 16 and 17-year olds within 12 weeks of a positive covid test"*

> If you had an active infection, you'll have antibodies high levels of antibodies to the active infection when you're given the vaccine. The vaccine will interact because the vaccine is the antigen and the antibodies will interact with that vaccine-based antigen and you'll get an inflammatory response which of course is what we don't want.

- Reduce further the "very very small risk" of myocarditis in under-18s.

# checking data from the british heart foundation.

- UK is giving Pfizer rather than Moderna.

- Can the Covid-19 vaccines cause myocarditis? **YES**

- In most cases of myocarditis, heart conditions return to normal.

- Cases are very rare but slightly less rare in children and young people.

- virtually all of the vaccinated children were *WITHOUT* long term side effects

## Getting covid-19 can itself lead to myocarditis, as well as other forms of severe illness.

They don't spell this out in Black and white terms, but!

- **COVID-19 myocarditis probability** is greater than *vaccine myocarditis probability*

## Who is at risk from myocarditis following the vaccine?

- Mostly affected young men aged 12-to-29

- Usually after their second dose

## Israel study

- In Israel, up to **4 in 100,000 MEN**.

- for women, it was fewer than *one in 100,000*

## Are children and young people at higher risk of heart inflammation from the vaccine?

- Cases of heart inflammation after the vaccine, while still very rare, are slightly less rare in children and younger adults (up to age of 39).

## In UK up to 15 December, 2021

- 39 cases of myocarditis or pericarditis

- that's 18 cases per million doses of vaccine.

- 18-29 year olds

> 29 per million doses

- 30-39 year olds

> 22 per million doses

## The report is from Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and 4 CMOs.

- confirmed the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is safe and effective for children aged 12-to-15 as well as vulnerable children from the age of 5...

> 'safe' is a statement that shouldn't be used in healthcare

- *John said '???????' to that statement.*

## Is there a risk of cardiac arrest from the Covid vaccine?

- *"No, there is no evidence that people are at risk of cardiac arrest in the days or weeks following the vaccine"*

- **This is based on a study of 4 million vaccinated in Denmark.**

- out of the 4 million, **269** had heart inflammation: most of these were young men.

### Professor Hoiby, message to world leaders.

- *"**ASPIRATE the damn shots before injection.**"*

- decrease in the heart inflammation rate as they started aspirating the needles.

- *Denmark vs. Norway*

> myocarditis 3 times more prevalent in Norway

- found there were no death or diagnoses of heart failure in people who were diagnosed with myocarditis or pericarditis after being vaxed.

- In the UK no figures have been published for cardiac arrests in under-18s following the vaccine -> ?

- which means there have been a tiny number too small to be published or none at all -> ?

- **Catching Covid-19, on the other hand, can significantly increase your risk of cardiac arrest and death**

## Is there any link between the covid-19 vaccine and cardiac arrests at football matches?

- *No, there isn't*, Although more research is being carried out in the long-term effects.

> very definitive, but is there data backing up this statement?

- *Having previously had a covid-19 infection is much more likely than the vaccine to lead to heart problems, although these cardiac arrests may not be linked to coronavirus infection either*

> This means it is more likely that those footballers were naturally infected prior to the great exertion. And vaccines were not the main cause.

## How would i know if I had myocarditis? 17:00

- symptoms generally appear within 3~5 days

- pain or tightness across the chest 

- pain in the neck that may spread across the shoulders and or arms.

- shortness of breath

- difficulty breathing, light-headed

- palpitations (irregular heart beat)

> Take EKG

### can vaccines cause changes to your heartbeat?

- YES, you are mounting an immunological reaction

- not like pathological tachycardia.

## diagnosed with myocarditis on the first dose 1, should I take dose 2?

- NO, if you had trouble with dose 1, dose 2 should not be taken unless a SENIOR professional tells you it's okay.

## if you had myocarditis previously, should I get the vax?

- yes, but consult with cardiologist.

## Sad videos of no aspirations.

> Canadians and British no aspiration yet.

> chief medical officer was following the guidelines but JC thinks that's WRONG.

- you do not know 100% that you haven't hit a vein.

## Cumbrea is aspirating.
