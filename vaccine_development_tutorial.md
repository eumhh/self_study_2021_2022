# Vaccine Development
- I. Safety

- II. Efficacy

    - **protective against disease (preventing the severity)** - current status.

    - protective against infection (prevent spread of the disease)

## Phases 

> [pre-clinial phase; Animal Testing] -> [Phase I: small pop. human trial] -> [Phase II: bit larger human trial] -> [Phase III: Large Human Trial] -> [FDA approval and manuscripts]

### Pre-Clinical Phase

- vaccine to animals

- monitor side-effects

- efficacy

- give the mice the virus -> did the vaccine work against the virus?

### Phase I

- vaccine to humans (small sample size <100 participants)

- humans that are healthy

- monitor side-effects

- dosage: Upper and Lower limit of the dose. Upper to see **increased side-effect** Lower to see **decreased antibody response**

### Phase II

- vaccine to humans (moderate sample size 100-1000 participants.)

- humans -> Match the demographics of population (age, race, gender, with/wo disease.)

- monitor side-effects

- double check the **dosage set from Phase I**

### Phase III

- vaccine to humans (large sample size 1000-10,000's)

- humans -> Match the demographics of population (age, race, gender, with/wo disease.)

- Monitor real life situation -> monitor symptoms -> PCR testing.

- Monitor real life situation -> PCR testing.

- Monitor control group : placebo.

### FDA approval

## Vaccine Mechanism

### I. Moderna and Pfizer/Biontech {mRNA vaccine}

- lipid nanoparticles wrapping the mRNA: acts as a vehicle to transport the mRNA into the cell; lipid-bilayer

- Taking the S protein to find the mRNA, and incorporate that into the lipid nanoparticle.

- the nanoparticle fuses to a host-cell (any kind of cell)

- It doesn't interact with the nucleus, it acts with the ribosome. -> translation happens.

- The mRNA will make viral-like proteins inside the cell and those proteins will be expressed on the walls of the cells (the complex on the walls).

- **MHC-II protein complex**: one of the antigen producing cells

    - B-cells
    - macrophages
    - dendritic cells

- **MHC-I protein complex**: in any nucleated cells (cells with cell membrane wall)

#### MHC-II complex response 

- When the viral-protein (S protein) made from our mRNA interacts with the MHC-II complex, it attracts a immune-related cell; T-helper cell(T_H)

- The interaction between the **viral-protein** and **T_H cell** is called the **TCR**

- Another interaction on the MHC-II complex is coupled, with the **CD4 protein**

- Then that t-cell is activated **IL-2, IL-4, IL5** are released. Which tells **B-cells to proliferate and differentiate**

    - B-cells proliferate and differentiate into special cells called **plasma cells**

    - When the plasma cells are developed/stimulated due to cytokines, they make **antibodies** that are directed against the viral-protein against the sars2-covid.

    - During the B-cell proliferation, **memory B-cells** get produced, which trigger **T-cells** to produce **memory T-cells**.

        - tons of immune response.

 #### MHC-I complex response 

- **Cytotoxic T-cells (T_CX)** interacts with the **MHC-I** with its TCR, which releases destructive molecules that destroy host cells  

- This is used to **destroy the host cells if infected with SARS-COV-2 virus in the future**. *Not the host cells processing the vaccine at that time*.

- But it also releases **same cytokines** *like IL-2, IL-4, IL-5* that will help the immune response.

#### The question is?

- How long does the antibodies last, and how long is it effective against the virus?

### II Astrazeneca/Oxford

- **Chimpanzee Adenovirus** is used 

    - The human immune system is not used to the chimp adenovirus and will not cause an immune response to the adenovirus, we want to trigger immune response to the protein inside the adenovirus.

- Inside of the chimp adenovirus, there is a **DNA molecule**, where the DNA inside the adenovirus that will generate proteins inside the injected cell, similar to the moderna/pfizer.

    - This DNA molecule is generated from the virus protein's S-protein -> mRNA -> DNA.

- When the adenovirus latches on to the cytoplasm of host cell, it will release the DNA, which **will go into the nucleus**, *does not incorporate into the DNA* but just **uses enzymes within the nucleus and transcribe to mRNA** according to AZ.

- The mRNA is released out to the nucleus and will interact with the ribosome.

- translation happens, and interacts with the MHC-II and MHC-I complex.

#### MHC-II and MHC-I response same as moderna/pfizer

- The MHC-I complex should destry the host cell later.

# How were the clinical trials taken?

## I. Moderna (get 2 doses, day 0 and day 28) => 14d -> Symptom? (tested.)

- Methods: 30,000 -> placebo vs. vaccine

    - **placebo** -> 185 people tested positive for covid-19 => 30 severe symptoms.

    - **vaccine** -> 11 people tested positive for covid-19 => 0 severe symptoms.

- Results: Efficacy of 2 end points.

    - **against the disease**: ((185-11)/185)*100 = 94.5%

    - **severe symptom**: 100%-0%= 100% efficacy against severity.

- **Storage/Temperature: Vaccine viable at -4 Farenheit, -20 Celcius**

- number of vaccines to be produced: 1 billion vaccines produced by end of 2021.

## II. Pfizer (get 2 doses, day 0 and day 21) => 7d -> Symptom? (tested.)

- Methods: 43,000 -> placebo vs. vaccine

    - **placebo** -> 162 people tested positive for covid-19 => 9 severe symptoms. (this may be due to the demographics.)

    - **vaccine** -> 8 people tested positive for covid-19 => 1 severe symptoms.

- Results: Efficacy of 2 end points.

    - **against the disease**: ((162-8)/162)*100 = 94.5%

    - **severe symptom**: 100%-(1/8)%= 87.5% efficacy against severity.

- **Storage/Temperature: Vaccine viable at -94 Farenheit, -70 Celcius**

- number of vaccines to be produced: 1.3 billion vaccines produced by end of 2021.

## III. AstraZen (get 2 doses, day 0 and day 28) => 14d -> **tested everyone**

- Methods: brazil 9000, UK 3000 -> placebo vs. vaccine

    - **placebo** (maningial coccal vaccine instead of saline like the mRNA)

    - **vaccine** in **brazil 1 dose + 1 dose**, in **UK 0.5 dose + 1 dose**

- Results:

    - Efficacy: 62% in Brazil, 90% in UK.

    - So they had to combine the samples from the 2 study.

    - **against the disease**: **~70%** 131 cases out of 12,000 total.

    - **severe symptom**: 100% efficacy against severity.

- Storage/Temperature: Vaccine viable at 36-46 Farenheit, 2.2-7.8 Celcius

- number of vaccines to be produced: 3 billion vaccines produced by end of 2021. If **0.5 + 1 dose** is viable, 4.5 billion units possible.

Moderna and Pfizer is studying against Symptom vs. AZ who are studying against disease (asymptomatic or not, they tested their participants.)
