```
 P1A gene sequence was optimized by substituting specific codons with synonymous ones while modulating the number of CpG motifs. 
 The P815A murine antigen production was increased with codon-optimized plasmids. 
 The number of CpG motifs within the P1A gene sequence modulated the immunogenicity by inducing a local increase in the cytokines involved in innate immunity. 
 After prophylactic immunization with the optimized vaccines, tumor growth was significantly delayed and mice survival was improved.
```

> key: the data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of optimized P1A vaccine against P815 mastocytoma, and they show the dual role played by codon optimization on both protein production and innate immune activation.

## compared effect of the vaccine between 4 types.
- The first one contained the non-optimized wild-type P1A sequence naturally carrying 21 CpG motifs (P1A_21). The three other sequences were codon-optimized (CO) and adapted to contain zero (P1A_CO0), 21 (P1A_CO21), or 50 (P1A_CO50) CpG motifs.

- To estimate the production of the P815A antigen, a 6X-His-tag was added downstream of the gene sequence in the plasmids used for P1A mRNA and P815A quantification. For all the other experiments, plasmids without 6X-His-tag were used.

## The CpG motifs may have an influence in the protein production.
- However, this is controversial in literature.

### Codon Optimization of Plasmids and Modulation of Their CpG Motif Content Significantly Influenced P815 Tumor Growth and Mouse Survival after Prophylactic Vaccination

### CD8+ Lymphocyte Infiltration in Tumor Was Higher Using CO Plasmids with Higher CpG Content

### Therapeutic Vaccination Using the CO P1A-Encoding Vaccine with the Highest Number of CpG Motifs Decreased Tumor Growth Rate and Prolonged Mouse Survival
