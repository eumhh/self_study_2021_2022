# Nanotechnology against covid-19: Immunization, diagnostic and therapeutic studies

## example of excellent vaccine candidate

**Key Features**

- safety

- the ability to elicit both antibody-mediated immunity (AMI) and cell-mediated immunity (CMI)

- long-lived immune responses

- Immune memory, even in elderly and immunocompromosied individuals

## Vaccine types

- whole-virus vaccines based on inactivated and live attenuated viruses

    - Codagenix/Serum institute (covi-vac), sinovac Biotech (CoronaVac), Wuhan Institute of Biological Products/Sinopharm (N.A.), 
    
    Beijing Institute of Biological Products/Sinopharm (BBIBP-CorV), Bharat Biotech (Covaxin/BBV152), 
    
    Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (N.A.), Research Institute for Biological Safety Problems (QazCovid-in), 

    Beijing Minhai Biotechnology Co. (N.A.), Valneva, National Institute for Health Research (VLA2001), Erciyes University (ERUCOV-VAC), and Shifa Pharmed Industrial Co (N.A.)

    - The inactivated virus vaccines may revert to virulence, and live attenuated virus vaccines induce a minimal cell-mediated immune response and require multiple booster doses.

- Subunit vaccinese (e.g., synthetic antigens, polysaccharides, proteins, lipoproteins, and glycoproteins).

    - Despite their high safety and reasonable cost, they mostly suffer from poor immunological memory and low immunogenicity.

    - similar to inactiviate viruses, protein subunit vaccines induce a weak T-cell response and run the risk of antibody-dependent infection.

    - use of adjuvants may address that issue and reduce the risk of antibody-dependent infection enhancement in this type of vaccine.

- nanovaccines

    - HBsAg functionalized solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) to deliver the surface antigen (HBsAg) to provide a subunit vaccine against hepatitis B virus; they proved that this method had a higher cellular uptake, lower cellular toxicity, and greater induction of type 1 immune responses including AMI and CMI.

    - the nanoparticles loaded with antigens and immune-stimulating compounds (adjuvants) can act in a similar manner to whole-cell vaccines to ensure protective immunity, without any risk of active infection, and produce immunological memory, especially in immunocompromised individuals.

## Antiviral nano-coatings for personal protective equipment (PPE)

- gloves face masks, face shields, and gowns can serve as a physical barrier against disease agents and viral pathogens.

- washable, reusable, and antimicrobial PPE with nano-coatings
