## The vaccine-less company results
This population is completely naive to the virus and the infection rate is very high

- Symptomatic vs. asymptomatics do exist in North K. but then again 220,000 = 2.5 million people have been sickened by "fever"

- Under treatment, 741,000 <- this is a lie.

- 66 death

Kim Jongeun is vaccinated.

cross-boarder smuggling between China and North Korea is one of the big source of virus outbreak.

**Omicron BA2 is being out numbered by BA4 BA5 in the Europe.**

- FYI BA2 is milder than BA1.

- The immune escape is a bit conerning but it does not seem more pathogenic vs. the Omicron BA2 variant.

The Shanghai shutdowns and outbreak is concerning.

President Biden with President Yoon Suk-yeol

We've offered vaccines, not only to North Korea but to China as well, and we're prepared to do that immediately

We've got no response

Declined offers from SK and others already, covax

Symptomatic cases, + 220,000 = 2.5 million people have been sickened by "fever"

Under treatment, 741,000

Medicines, oxygen, electricity, frequent blackouts, fridges

Deaths, 66

Nationwide lockdown

Claimed successfully kept Covid out by sealing borders

State media

Herbal tea, gargling salt-water, ibuprofen

Kim Jong-un, officials bungled distribution of national medicine reserves

Mobilised a million health workers, find people with fevers, quarantine

We understand why the initial response of China was to try and suppress infections to the maximum level (but) that strategy is not sustainable

a suppression-only strategy is not a sustainable way to exit the pandemic for any country

Unchecked transmission, North Korea, Eritrea could spur the emergence of new variants

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus

zero-COVID, not sustainable

WHO is deeply concerned at the risk of further spread in North Korea,

Worrying numbers of people with underlying conditions

Has asked North Korea to share more data, no response

WHO had offered vaccines, medicines, tests and technical support, no response

UK

Britain reduces its Covid-19 alert level from four to three, Omicron-variant wave of the virus was subsiding.

Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 newly classified as variants of concern
