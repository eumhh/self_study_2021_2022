# RNA expression cassette tutorial - Moon Seuntae Pro

## preventing reverse state
ARCA -> beta-S-ARCA 

## TLR7/8 and TLR3 pathway will prevent the vaccines from being translated.

## CUREVAC

- focused on 5'UTR and 3'UTR combination, and chose from 1 million sequences.

- ribosome-related sequence

- GOI (gene of interest): usually spike (S) protein

histone stem group is associated to the up-regulated expression in the S-phase in cell cycle.

**30-C tail** following the polyA is a Human antigen R binding motif: Hu-family relatives in antagonizing mRNA degradation pathway.

    - shielding + distancing (according to Moon & Kim pro)

    - Patents related to the CUrevac platform: a lot of sequences, please check the slides.

## Moderna

    - codon optimization is related to the **traffic jam** (ribosome traffic pileup) and immature cutting of the mRNA.

    - codon optimization + UTR screening 

## BioNTech

Capping technique and 

polyA linker

    - [A30 -Linker- A70]

    - Linker stops deanylase

## MOON

eIF4E is a key factor in mRNA translation.

    -> if the mRNA is coupled with eIF4E as a complex and put in, what could happen? (stop)

importance of PAIP1 vs. PAIP2

3'UTR as linker between polyA

## IRE (iron response element)

    - body accumulating iron will trigger translation.

## IRES

**EMCV** (500bp) or CrPV (100bp).

- EMCV interacts with the capping proteins

- CrPV is a knot-based which might or might not work
