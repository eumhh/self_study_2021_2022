# Covid-19 and Vitamin D association

## 1. Vitamin D decrease is associated with increased mortality in Hospitalized covid-19 patients.

## 2. Low level vitamin D assocaited with longer days of mechanical ventilation.

## 3. lower vitamin D associated with higher SARs COVID2 positive PCR's.

## 4. lower vitamin D associated with higher CRP, Fibrinogen, D-dimer levels in covid-19 patients (massive inflammation)

## 5. low vitamin D associated with lower clearance of SARS-COV2

## 6. low vitamin D associated with elderly, african americans, obesity, and hispanics

## 7. low vitamin D associated with Risk of several diseases (diabetes, hypertension, etc.).

## 8. vitamin D has been shown to be affective against viral respiratory tract infections (RSV, influenza, rhinovirus).

## Going over why 1~8 is possible.

### Sources of vitamin D

- milk

- egg yolks

- yogurts

- cereals

- liver

- mushrooms


## systemic flow of vitamin D when they go into the body 

vitamin D is a fat soluable hormone.

- You need fat to be appropriately absorbed through our G.I.tract

vitamin D's full name is **cholecalciferol** (c.c.f)

From the skin

- 7-dehydro-cholesterol + sunlight -> **c.c.f** or the **vitamin D**

vitamin D binding proteins inside the bloodstream transports the c.c.f

- it moves to the **liver**

CCF gets stimulated by particular enzyme called **25-hydroxylase** (adds OH to the 25th carbon of CCF)=> **25-OH CCF**

- it moves to the kidney; and in the proximal convoluted tubules, **1-alpha-hydroxylase** enzyme binds with **25-OH CCF** => **1,25-DOH CCF** (*active form of vitamin D*)

    - active vitamin D helps Calcium 2+ absorption, and Calcium 2+ in blood.

inside a macrophage, active form of vitamin D can be made with the **1-alpha-hydroxylase** to convert **25-OH CCF**

- Vitamin D receptor protein lets the 1,24-DOH CCF into the nucleus, and make certain mRNA, and then make proteins.

- proteins made inside macrophage 

    - Beta-defensins: anti-microbial proteins

        - they "punch" holes in the viral envelopes (phospholipid bilayers)

        - potential: destruction of the virus

            - see this in RSV, Rhinovirus, Influenza Virus

    - cathelicidins: anti-microbial proteins

        - Proteolysis (cleaves) of viral peptides

        - An increase in cathelicidin expression will result in macrophages stiumlation; which increases activity of macrophages

        - they act on small capillaries, and increase the vascular permeability. Causes more macrophages like white blood cells to go to where virus are "CHEMOTAXIS"

        - In a case where macrophages engulfs (phagocytosis), a viral particle, it becomes a **phagosome**. combines with a **lysosome**, and becomes **phagolysosome**

            - breaks down the actual virus like a blender, and a piece from that virus will get stock on a protein complex on the membrane - **MHC-II complex**

            - One of the viral peptides, **S-protein**, will bind on the **MHC-II as antigen** then a particular cell clicks in with the **MHC-II + antigen**. - a naive T-cell with the TCR. that interaction is called **CD4**

            - depending on the cytokines, this takes a split path:

                - IL-4 will make it become TH2 Cell, IL-4 and IL-5 will make the TH2 Cell to a B-cell, which will later become Plasma Cells

                    - The plasma cells throw out antibodies that will bind with the S-proteins, which can enhance complement system. enhance immune response. increase phagocytosis. helps neutralize the virus.

                - IL
