## Cannot stop omicron spreading.
### Huge peaks in UK, but death going down.
The number of cases in US and Australia is grossly underestimated due to lack of testing.

## USA Jan - 12th
- millions of new cases.

### California

- 3.9 times more likely to get omicron symptomatic infection than unvaccinated.

### Florida

- highly vaccinated population, but breakthrough infection. So, vaccination is to prevent severe symptoms not omicron protection it seems.

### New York

- three subway lines out

- 1,700 death per day (how many are unvaccinated here?)
