# immune system study - antibody structure and function

> GAMED (gives all the antibodies we need to know.)

## IgG

- most abundant antibody

- 65-70% found within the blood plasma (or extracellular fluids)

- plasma cells produce these antibodies

- IgG is a **monomer**; only one of them.

- produced in **both primary and secondary**, but more **abundant in the secondary** immune response

### in case of bacteria

- cell membrane of the bacterias may have antigens. IgG antibodies can bind to them and activate the complement system.

    - They can form **Membrane Attack Complex** (MAC) or enhance **Opsonization**

### in case of virus

- IgG can bind to every single one of the antigens of the virus

    - **neutralization of the virus**

### in case of free antigen

- IgG can bind and precipitation can occur

    - enhance **Phagocytosis** or **Opsonization**

- It can pass through the placenta, which allow for these antibodies to circulate to the baby

    - The baby will have passive immunity

## IgA

- The IgA is a **dimer**, 2 joined.

- fluids of the body; saliva, skin (sweat), mucosal lining of the G.I. tract, within the milk (lactation).

    - mother can **pass the IgA to the baby**.

- can bind to two antigens (two bacteria or bacteria + 1 microbe)

## IgM

- plasma cells primarily secretes this antigen

- **pentamer** 5 openings, and **also secreted in the monomer** state (b-cell receptor).

- made during **primary immune response**

- diagnostic tool, that some person is going through a primary exposure of something.

- monomeric antibody can bind to the antigens

- the pentameric antibody can bind to 5 antigens of 5 red-blood cells that received mismatch blood transfusion.

    - Agglutination can happen. Type II hypersensitivity

- the **pentamer** has  **10 antigen binding sites** not 5.

## IgE

- plasma cells priarily secretes the antigen

- **monomer** monomeric protein (can act as white bloodcell receptor; bind to parasites and gets white blood cells to kill it)

- Found in Respiratory Tract mucosa, GI tract mucosa, urogenital structures, lamina propria or lymphatic tissues, small traces in blood plasma.

- in the RT-mucosa, mass cells with receptors that are FcE(epsilon)R1-receptor will have these antibodies bind to it.

- when IgE is activated, the mass cells like Histamines, leukotrienes, Prostaglandins.

    - cause wide spread vasodilation happens 

    - cause the blood vessles to get leaky

    - the mass cells can bind on to the smooth muscle cells and make them contract. In bronchi, such process can result Anaphalxis (type-I hypersensitivity)

## IgD

- plasma cells primarily secrete this antigen

- **monomer** good for B cell receptor


## Antibody abundance graph

- the primary immune response antibody abundance and secondary immune response antibodies have some lag time between their secretion.

- in **primary, IgM** activated and goes down; in **secondary, IgG** abundance goes up.

The shift from IgM -> IgG **isotype switching**

- the somatic hypermutation gives a affinity maturation in the form of hypermutation of the CDRs in the light & heavy chain - particularly CDR3.

- In the first wave, IgM starts first and IgG comes, but in the second wave, there are cases that the body adapts to the pathogen and IgG and IgM wave starts at the same time and the IgG abundance increases in extreme measure.


# Immunity
## Passive

- Naturally Acquired

    - IgG through placenta

    - IgA by the milk from mother

- Artificially Acquired

    - antivenom (i.e. snakebite)

        - immunoglobulins (antibodies) that are against the venom in a snake.

## Active

- Naturally Acquired

    - Infection by pathogen

- Artificially 

    - Vaccines and Booster shots

# Antibody Structure
![image](http://microbiologyinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Structure-of-Antibody2.jpg)

- Constant Heavy Chain C_H

- Constant Light Chain C_L

- Variable Heavy Chain V_H

- Variable Light Chain V_L

They have disulfide bonds linking each other.

## Why is this important?

The complement proteins bind to the C_H

the Variable regions differ for each antibody.

- differentiate for antigens.

One antibody has 2 antigen binding sites.

- each V_H, V_L combination can make a specific antigen binding site.
