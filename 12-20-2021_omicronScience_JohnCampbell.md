 - large replications in the bronchial passages rather than the lung tissue itself.

    - 폐에 들어가는 기관지 rather than 폐

- alveoli (폐포)

    - in previous variants:
    
        - o2 gets out and CO2 goes in, which consolidates (fill up with liquid) the alveoli and result in pneumonia.

        - note that alveoli has to be emptied up and work with oxygen, not liquid.

    - in omicron:

        - It affects the bronchi to the lungs rather than the lungs itself.
        
            - 70 times fater than the Delta in the Bronchus.

            - much faster as it will BREATHE OUT and infect others.
        
        - This results in bronchitis rather than pneumonia.
        
        - significantly lower in the lungs compared to the original SARS-CoV-2 -> this leads to the severity going down (less pathogenic)
                
    - validated with ex-vivo (outside of life) culteres of respiratory tract: lung tissue from patient has been cultured outside of the body.

- Omicron will be less pathogenic (will kill less percentage of the infected), but can kill more as it will infect much more of the population.

    - 1000 delta with 1% is equal to 10,000 with 0.1%. Simple math.

    - the overall threat can get higher.

Does this obey the 'Koch's postulate'?

    - This is THE guideline on 'How to decide if the disease is transmissible or not'.

    - **The Koch's postulates**:

        1. The microorganism must be found in abundance in all organisms suffering from the disease but should not be found in healthy organisms.

        2. The microorganism must be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure culture.

            - Chan group did this ex-vivo.

        3. The cultured microorganism should caused disease when introduced into a healthy organism.

        4. The microorganism must be reisolated from the inoculated, diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the original specific causative agent.

for the SARS-CoV2 omicron this has been met.
