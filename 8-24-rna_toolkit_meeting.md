## PJT 설명

secondary structure prediction tool setup ASAP

The next steps will have more weight

- Codon usage optimization

- UTR sequence optimization

    - 3' UTR [minimal size, fixed] - to keep the regulatory regions simple as possible.

    - 5' UTR specific - have to double-check the structures of 5'UTRS

LinearDesign, mxfold2, rnafold, gc content-based, etc. has to be taken into consideration

## General PJT update **ACTION ITEM**
Each terms and blocks has to be broken down in to more specific details

**Mini timelines** - Focus on setting up the specific timelines for this. This can be edited along the way.

Some of these terms may have their derivatives feed into one another.

    - 2D structure

    - CDS optimize

    - UTRs

    - explorative

Requirement, estimated time, target due date

Mind-mapping -> listing -> grouping; **when presenting**

### secondary structure prediction

- what is our philosophy/strategy for this?

- how will the concurent tools (and their results be) weighted?

## Explorative

- highly expressed genes, lowly but stable, etc.

    - looking for specific patterns in the UTRs, CDS, etc.

- Find all factors and then give weights to each.

## 외부 resource

- outsourcing or 채용 or 협력

## 그룹장님-based priority

[Secondary structure] planning.

REQUIREMENTS for both dry and wet lab.
