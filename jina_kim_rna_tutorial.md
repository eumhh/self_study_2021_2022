- translation happens as a **closed loop** not straight-line mRNA.

- 'co-transcriptional capping'  or 'transcription -> capping'

- IVT (*in vitro* transcribed) 

- *in vivo* delivery is difficult

- dsRNA is not translated, but only activates immune response

- Artificual nucleotides

    - reduce immune response and increase protein epression

    - **pseudouridine**; to dodge immune response

- 5'-cap 

    - in the Decapping process, the mRNA stability is dependent on the time it takes to decap.

    - cap-0,1,2 and ARCA is used mostly.

    - 5' to 5' interaction. And then methylation of the following carbon rings will resultl in cap 0 -> cap 1 -> cap 2

    - The cap 0 can be found as reverse state. 

- Enzyme-based capping vs. **co-transcriptional capping** (ARCA is standard).

    - enzyme-based has higher capping efficiency, but it is more laborious, expensive, diff to control, and quality control steps added.

    - co-transcriptional capping has a simple step and ARCA only creates correctly capped RNA, but low mRNA transcription efficiency happens due to the manufactured-RNAs competing.

- CleanCap analog: the cap has 2 basepair nucleotides stuck to it.

    - GTP ratio does not need optimization, has similar simplicity as co-transcriptional capping.

- Poly A length and structure affects stability and translation efficacy of mRNA

- 3'-3' linkage used by moderna.

    - inverted deoxythymidine (idT)

    - length of poly A tail > 100 and max 200 bp.

- poly A ^ = stability ^

- IRES (internal ribosome entry sites) induces cap-independent translation.

- mtRNR1-AES combination better than 2h-beta-globin.

    - but *in vivo* and *in vitro* had discordant results.

**self-amplifying mRNA** can be a solution for short half life, but also a target for viral replication (may be dangerous)

    - low concentration still gives similar expression level.

**Trans-amplifying mRNA** needs extra non-replicating mRNA, and it needs a bit more development for practical use.

-Sequence optimization

    - tRNA ^ = higher efficiency

    - GC% ^ = mRNA stability goes up

    - ubiquitinization to reduce protein from getting pulled

Albumin Binding helps & Ubiquitin site mutation and poly A site modification: two known for rna structure stability

**purification of U and pseudo U; the charge difference is significant.**

BIONTECH vaccine details: look on the slide.

Moderna - manufacturing details: look on the slide

- endonuclease sites help linearizing of the sequence and located immediately downstream of the polyA tail.

- T7 polymerase: Moderna T7 that helps dsRNA from being generated.

**TAKE HOME MESSAGE**

- It is important to choose the right disease to cure.
