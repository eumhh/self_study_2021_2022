# re-learning python.


## make new conda environment called tf, and install packages, activate conda and run programs.
### so far, after installing anaconda, I had to conda install *pandas, tensorflow*
### note that keras had to be re-installed using admin version ANACONDA prompt cmd with 'pip install keras'
#### conda install didn't work for *keras*
conda create -n tf

conda install -n tf {package_name}

conda activate tf

conda deactivate
