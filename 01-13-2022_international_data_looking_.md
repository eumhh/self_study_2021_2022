## Reduction of Delta as Omicron increases. Netherlands.
The actual hospital cases are much better than the most optimistic prediction of December.

- Omicron has essentially replaced Delta

# Background
## In California
time point: November 30, 2021 ~ Jan 1, 2022.

detection method: Using the S gene target failure (99.7%) to call the variant omicron.

**Omicron cases N = 52,297**; these are detected, there will be much more infected.

- 235 went to Hospital admissions (0.5%)

- 88 admitted (usually less than 5.5 days of stay in the hospitals)

- 7 ITU (intensive care)

- 0 Ventilation

- 1 death

This is comparable to **Delta N = 16,982**.

- 222 went to Hospital admissions (1.3%)

- 189 admitted (average 15.8 days of stay in the hospitals)

- 23 ITU (intensive care)

- 11 Ventilation

- 14 death

## 80 year-old Delta patient much more likely to be admitted to hospital compared to 80 year-old Omicron patient. Diabetic patients have urgency.
- IN ANY GROUP, you are less likely to be admitted to hospital with Omicron compared to having Detla Variant.

# Common cold protection
- Cross-reactive memory T cells associate with protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 contacts

- **Cross-reactive** group means a person has been exposed to one of the 4 COVID-19 variants.

- 52 COVID-19 household contacts

- enumerate the frequency of specific T cells

- spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, envelope and ORF1 that cross-react with human endemic coronaviruses.

- The COVID-19 cross-immunity is proved for SARS-CoV-2

**protecting SARS-CoV-2-naive variants.**

- thereby supporting the inclusion of non-spike antigens in second-generation vaccines.

The Long term immune effects are from the T-Cells.

Most of the vaccines went for the antibodies, but not the T-Cells, so many that's the future?

## Data from India

"Most infectious respiratory virus in history."

- More than Measles (if somebody in the room has it, 90% will get it)

- x3 to x5 infectious than Delta

- Vaccines will not prevent infections, but does protect against severe disease.
