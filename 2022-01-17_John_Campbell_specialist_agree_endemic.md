## So far, how the omicron variant looks.
~10 days from the initial infection is where the infected becomes immune, and get negative PCR results.

## The Omicron (not knowing the long-term effect) is much less virulent.
- 4 Observations: Confirmed Cases, Patients in hospital, Pattients ventilated, confirmed deaths.

## Omicron Restrictions are not at all helpful. *SCOTLAND* vs. UK is the proof.
- Data is data.

- Germany, the Omicron has replaced Delta, much like South Africa and UK.

- In Spain, the Delta is still there. Have to shift towards Omicron.

- Israel, there were no Delta, this is just all Omicron.

## Marco Calveri, from European Medicines Agency, head of biological health threats and vaccines strategy.
- he has said: "Repeat vaccinations and consecutive boosters, will **REDUCE** immune response". BUT those posts are no longer in the public domain.

### WHAT is available NOW. (please note it is not saying that consecutive boosters have an immuno-suppressing effect.)
- *"Boosters, can be done once, or maybe twice, but it's not something that we can think should be repeated constantly"*

- *"We need to think about how we can transition from the current pandemic setting to a more **ENDEMIC** setting."*

- *"With omicron, there will be a lot of natural immunity taking place on top of vaccination"*

- *"We will be fastly moving towards the scenario of endemicity"* - this means the vaccinations will likely become a **CHOICE** again. But there will be vulnerable populations (elderly, autoimmune disease, etc.) that may require (strongly-suggested) vaccination.

- *"Fourth dose for all does not yet been generated to support this approach. Repeated vaccination does not represent a sustainable long term strategy"* - please note that **this is not saying multi-dose is immuno-suppressing.**

## The full-shift from *Delta* to *Omicron*
- Doesn't mean the hospitals are not going to have problems.

- There will be deaths and severe cases.

- Omicron == endemic

- Definition of endemic: 'Consisitent and predictable' not 'boom and bust'

- Measles 7th most common factor of death in children in the world in poorly vaccinated areas.

- Note that Measles had 90% infection rate when in a same room. Omicron is said to be more infectious.

### Julian Hiscox, Chair in infection and global health, university of Liverpool. (UK, New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group).

- *"We're almost there, it is now the beginning of the end, at least in the UK"*

- "life in 2022 will be almost back to before the pandemic"

- "A new variant should be very minor"

- "If you want 0-covid, then there will be government restrictions. 0-covid in China **WILL FAIL**"

- This just means, **we have to accept the circulation and take care of the symptomatic patients.**

- Maybe like ~300 death per day globally, is something we should accept.

###Dr Elisabetta Groppelli,
- An average person should be okay.
