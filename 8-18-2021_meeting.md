# 8-18-2021 meeting

## Timeline Review

- what to share with 그룹장님

- codon optimization + @

## General discussion

- RNA 박사 1인 interview (maybe 채용)

## Required materials

- 시약

    - 1M7 acylation is hard to use with nanopore

    - Aclm acylation can be used for nanopore

- ShapeMap

- shapemapper

- Tombo

- nanopolish

## Top sequences  

- is there a way to run structures and trim out the garbage?

## TO DO LIST

### Park Pro

- ShapeMap 

- optical melting (pseudo U measurement for thermo)

- PABP attachment (with sequence?)

- AU rich and CG rich mix and match

### Yoon and Moon

- shortcut sequences

- pseudo-U needed for thermo version

- 3'UTR (minimal) and 5'UTR (should be similar) length viability

- stop codon 바로 뒤에 conserved region이 존재

- 3'UTR can have a major effect on stability

- pseudo-U thermodynamics, U and pseudo-U replacement on structure.

- workstation setup: programs and etc.
